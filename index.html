                    Emily Dickinson, in full Emily Elizabeth Dickinson, (born December 10, 1830, Amherst, Massachusetts, U.S.—died May 15, 1886,
                    Amherst), American lyric poet who lived in seclusion and commanded a singular brilliance of style and
                    integrity of vision. With Walt Whitman, Dickinson is widely considered to be one of the two leading 19th-century
                    American poets.

                    Only 10 of Emily Dickinson’s nearly 1,800 poems are known to have been published in her lifetime. Devoted to private pursuits,
                    she sent hundreds of poems to friends and correspondents while apparently keeping the greater number
                    to herself. She habitually worked in verse forms suggestive of hymns and ballads, with lines of three
                    or four stresses. Her unusual off-rhymes have been seen as both experimental and influenced by the 18th-century
                    hymnist Isaac Watts. She freely ignored the usual rules of versification and even of grammar, and in
                    the intellectual content of her work she likewise proved exceptionally bold and original. Her verse is
                    distinguished by its epigrammatic compression, haunting personal voice, enigmatic brilliance, and lack
                    of high polish.
